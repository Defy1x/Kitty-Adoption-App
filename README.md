# Project:
## Title:
# Kitty-Adoption-App

## Description:
A React JS app for Adopting and posting kitties up for adoption! ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜ºðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜½

I worked by myself on this project. I did all the UX/ UI Design. I am using the following technologies: Sequelize ORM, Node, Express, HTML/CSS, JS, React for client side rendering.

## User Story

```
AS A KITTY LOVER who frequently wants to save cats
I WANT an application
SO THAT I can easily adopt all the kitties in my region or post kitties up for adoption.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
